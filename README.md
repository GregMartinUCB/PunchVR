# PunchVR

A VR exercise game based on boxing. Using the HTC Vive, players will dodge a gaint laser while using their boxing gloves to puch bombs back to the boss. This game is designed to force players to move. The bombs make you move your arms while the gaint laser the enemy shoot forces you to squat.

This game is being developed on my spare time, primarily as a learning experience. I will try to keep the zip file with the build updated, however there is a chance that it could be a couple commits behind. Feel free to try it, play it, and give some feedback. I'm new to developing and I am definitely not a 3d artist. I created everything except the sounds and the SteamVR asset.
